# SimpleUnityGifInputer
2D unity gif inputer

Since the gif input source provided by 2d unity does not exist, it was implemented with a simple code. The way is to separate the gif into sprites and put them in a folder under Resources/Arts. Just put the code in the desired spriter and enter the folder location. EX) Actual location: Assets/Resources/Arts/Rocketsample, Location to write code: Arts/Rocketsample
